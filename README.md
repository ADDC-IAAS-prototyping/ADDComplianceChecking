# ADDCompliance

This repo contains the prototype for checking compliance of pattern-based architectural design decisions during runtime.
The repo contains the following projects:

- **constraintCheckingComponent**: contains a complex event processing (CEP) engine which can be configured for behavioral compliance monitoring during runtime. It also contains unit tests to examplify the approach based on the Watchdog and Circuit Breaker pattern.

- **dsl**: contains an editor for the developed Constraint Definition Language.
